# Does an algorithm actually exist to perform a given task?
#
# If someone proposes an algorithm to solve a task, are we sure that
#   the algorithm works for all possible inputs?
# How long does the algorithm take to run? How much memory space does
#   it require?
# Once we know itâ€™s possible to solve a problem with an algorithm,
#   a natural question is whether the algorithm is the best
#   possible one. Can the problem be solved more quickly?
